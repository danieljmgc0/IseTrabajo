abstract = {The pluralistic usability walkthrough is a collaborative usability evaluation method develop by Randolph Bias that involves both users and members of the product team. In this method, a facilitator presents participants with an image of the interface for each step in a task and ask them to write down what they would do at each step to get to the next step in a task. After the participants have written their answers for each step, the facilitator reveals the “correct answer” and invites discussion.}
